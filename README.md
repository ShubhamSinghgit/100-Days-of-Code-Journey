# 100-Days-of-Code-Journey

Overview:
Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my #100DaysOfCode journey! This repository serves as a daily log of my coding progress and learning experiences over the next 100 days. During this challenge, my primary focus will be on enhancing my skills in web development, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I will embark on a journey to learn Python, giving priority to web development projects. Whenever time permits, I will dive into fundamental concepts of DevOps to broaden my skill set.
This README file provides an overview of the repository and outlines what to expect during this coding challenge.

How to Navigate :
Start with the daily log for the current day (day-XX/log.md) to follow my latest updates.
Explore the projects folder for detailed documentation on larger coding endeavors.

My GOALS: 

1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Mastery:

a. Gain proficiency in building responsive and visually appealing web pages using HTML and CSS.
b. Enhance my JavaScript skills by working on practical projects and solving coding challenges. I will be following JavaScript30 Challenge.

2. Python Proficiency:

a. Learn and practice Python programming, with a focus on application in web development projects.
b. Explore Python's versatility in various coding challenges and mini-projects.

3. DevOps Fundamentals:

a. Understand the basics of DevOps and its role in the software development lifecycle.
b. Explore key tools and practices associated with DevOps, such as version control, continuous integration, and deployment.


### Daily Updates ### 

Each day, I will commit my progress to the corresponding daily log file. The logs will include:
i. Summary of the day's coding activities.
ii. Code snippets or links to the projects worked on.
iii. Challenges faced and solutions discovered.
iv. Reflections on the learning experience.

### Repository Structure ###
/day-01 to /day-100: Each directory corresponds to a specific day of the challenge.

Inside each daily directory, you will find:
a. A markdown file (log.md) summarizing the day's progress.
b. Code files or project folders associated with the day's work.
c. /projects: Separate folder for larger projects undertaken during the challenge.
